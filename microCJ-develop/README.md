# microCJ
A 3D, multilevel agent-based tumour modelling framework. \
New general repository with the complete code for microCJ. \
Check `master` for stable releases, and `develop` for the latest changes.

# Usage
MicroCJ can be used in two ways: using the graphical user interface (GUI) or the command line interface (CLI).
The GUI is self explanatory, although check this space for in-depth user instructions in the future.
For the CLI, this is the usage summary:
```
microcj [-hV] <settings> <iterations> <steps>
A 3D, multilevel agent-based tumour modelling framework.
      <settings>             the name of the xml file containing the desired settings
      <iterations>           number of simulations to be run
      <steps>                number of steps each simulation will run for
  -h, --help                 Show this help message and exit.
